# **1.4. Your First Python Program: "Hello, World!"**  

"Hello, World!" is the traditional first program in any language. It helps verify that Python is correctly installed and working.

## **1.4.1. Writing and Running "Hello, World!"**  

### **1.4.1.1. Running Python in Interactive Mode (REPL)**  
Python has an interactive shell where you can type and execute code directly.  

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.  
2. Type `python3` (or `python` on Windows if Python 3 is default) and press **Enter**.  
3. Youâ€™ll see a prompt like this:  
   ```
   Python 3.x.x (default, ...)  
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  
   >>>  
   ```
4. Type the following command and press **Enter**:  
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
5. Python will output:  
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
6. To exit the interactive mode, type:  
   ```python
   exit()
   ```
   or press **Ctrl + D** on macOS/Linux, or **Ctrl + Z** on Windows.

### **1.4.1.2. Writing "Hello, World!" in a Python Script**  
Instead of using interactive mode, you can save Python code in a file and run it.  

1. Open a text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or Notepad++).  
2. Type the following code:  
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. Save the file as **hello.py**.  
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the fileâ€™s location.  
5. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python3 hello.py
   ```
   or  
   ```sh
   python hello.py
   ```
6. Output:  
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
